* I/O ports
  - Both need actual I/O to something.

* Co-processors
  - Concept needs work; I have no idea how I'm going to do this, yet;
    nevermind how I'm going to implement it.

* Misc
  - An assembler, because hand-assembling is a pain in the arse.

* Code
  - Need to re-implement IRQs
  - Nede to better-handle stack under/over flow.
